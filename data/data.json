      "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize the eCommerce landscape. In 2024, the focus is shifting toward using AI for personalizing the shopping experience. By applying machine learning technologies, online stores can offer users products and services that best match their interests and preferences. Analyzing data from previous purchases, viewed pages, and even the time of day, AI can predict user behavior and provide personalized recommendations in real-time. This not only increases conversions but also makes the shopping process more convenient and enjoyable for customers. Additionally, AI is actively used for optimizing logistics, inventory management, review processing, and demand forecasting, helping businesses operate more efficiently and offer customers better conditions.",

      "description": "Microanimations are small yet significant elements that greatly improve the user experience on websites and mobile apps. In 2024, microanimations are becoming a key trend in UX/UI design. These subtle animations help users better understand interfaces, improving navigation and making interactions more intuitive. For example, an animation when clicking a button can confirm the successful completion of an action, and a slight effect when hovering over an element can indicate that it is interactive. Microanimations can also enhance the emotional connection with a product, making it more 'human' and engaging. Companies that implement microanimations in their products report improved user experience, increased engagement, and higher user satisfaction.",
